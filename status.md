Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have decided to alter the plan for my project. Instead of creating a website that allows you to buy and sell stocks. I want to create a website that allows you to search stocks and view key stock information, such as current price, market cap, sector, and investment analysis. I also want the platform to allow the user to simulate investments through a chosen time frame and view their potential earnings.

I have created the login/register page for my website as well as the research page that allows the user to search for stocks and view their key information.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still plan on creating the potential earnings page for my website. I also want to create graphs for every stock you would like to research that show their growth over the years.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have never used the Firebase database. I struggled with connecting my Firebase to my code to ensure that my user registration was saved into a database.
