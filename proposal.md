# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

- Trading Simulator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

- I want to create a website that allows the user trade stocks. The webstie will incorporate a login page that takes them to another page that allows the user to buy and sell stocks of their choice.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

- The first page will incorporate a register/login page. My software should be able to recognize a new or incorrect username or password to safely allow users into their portfolio. The login page will have a button to register if you are a new user as well. When you move to the portfolio page you will have button that take you to a buying page that allows you to buy a certain stock and however many shares you want of that stock. The portfolio page will also have a selling page that allows you to sell whatever stock you own and the amount of shares that you decide. Your portolio page will also be able to show the stock that you own and their value amount based on the amount of shares you bought. This entire platform will incorporate HTML/CSS and Python. There will be interactive buttons to make the website functional. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

- N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

- N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- There will be a login page, a buying page, a selling page, and a portfolio page.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- There will be a a login/register page, a buying page, a selling page, a portoflio page, and a deposit money button.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- There will be a login/register page with a password change option, a buying page, a selling page, a portoflio page that increases money over time as the actual stocks would, and a deposit money button.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

- I need to learn the syntax of HTML/CSS. I will research how to incorporate python functions into my HTML/CSS webpage layout. I will also research financial trading platoforms to see if there are any keys functions in there website that I am missing. If I am able to achieve the goals of what I HOPE to acoomplish, I will have to incorporate real-time data of these stocks such as a trading API that regularly updates stock prices. I will also have to learn how to utilize this API and add it into my website so it displays the updates.
